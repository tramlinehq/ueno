## Creating release build

### Play Store

To generate a release build you need two files that are not, for good reasons, part of this repository:

- `ueno-upload-keystore.jks` in the `android/app` directory.
- `key.properties` in the `android` directory.

You can get these files from our Google Cloud Storage account.
